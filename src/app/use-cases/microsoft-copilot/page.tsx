    {
      id: 'faq-1',
      question: 'How does ANALYZE know what Microsoft Copilot is saying about us?',
      answer: 'ANALYZE monitors how Microsoft Copilot answers real buyer-style prompts (for example "best [category] for [ICP]," "[Competitor] alternatives," "[Tool] vs [Tool] for [Use Case]"). We capture how you\'re described, whether you\'re recommended, and which competitors are offered instead — so you can see how Microsoft Copilot positions you in live evaluation moments.'
    },
    {
      id: 'faq-2',
      question: 'Can ANALYZE show when Microsoft Copilot recommends a competitor instead of us?',
      answer: 'Yes. You\'ll see a list of prompts where Microsoft Copilot puts a competitor forward and leaves you out. For each of those prompts, you\'ll see who\'s getting recommended, how they\'re being pitched, and which proof points Microsoft Copilot is repeating on their behalf. This is your "we\'re losing qualified demand here" map.'
    },
    {
      id: 'faq-3',
      question: 'Can I see why Microsoft Copilot is choosing that competitor?',
      answer: 'Yes. ANALYZE shows the exact language Microsoft Copilot is using to justify the recommendation and the specific URLs and domains it\'s citing as evidence. You get the messaging, claims, and assets that are winning that moment — not just "you lost."'
    },
    {
      id: 'faq-4',
      question: 'Can ANALYZE show if Microsoft Copilot is sending us traffic, not just talking about us?',
      answer: 'Yes. By connecting GA4, you can see how many sessions Microsoft Copilot is driving to your site, which pages those visitors land on, and which pages convert. You can answer "Is Microsoft Copilot creating pipeline for us?" with real numbers instead of screenshots.'
    },
    {
      id: 'faq-5',
      question: 'Can I track how our visibility in Microsoft Copilot changes over time?',
      answer: 'Yes. ANALYZE shows how often you appear, how you\'re positioned, who you\'re compared to, and whether that\'s trending up or down. If Microsoft Copilot starts preferring a competitor for a high-intent use case, you\'ll see it before Sales feels it.'
    },
    {
      id: 'faq-6',
      question: 'Will ANALYZE tell me which prompts we should go win first in Microsoft Copilot?',
      answer: 'Yes. ANALYZE ranks the highest-value prompts you\'re currently losing in Microsoft Copilot — the ones most tied to buying intent — and shows you which to fix first. That gives PMM, content, and demand gen a focused "work on these now" list instead of 200 vague ideas.'
    },
    {
      id: 'faq-7',
      question: 'Does this replace SEO tools?',
      answer: 'No. SEO tools tell you how you rank in traditional web search. ANALYZE tells you how Microsoft Copilot talks about you, who Microsoft Copilot is recommending, which competitors it positions you against, and whether Microsoft Copilot is driving traffic and conversions. This is AI buying-path visibility and attribution, not classic search rank tracking.'
    },
    {
      id: 'faq-8',
      question: 'Do I need engineering resources to set this up?',
      answer: 'No. You don\'t need to ship code or embed a script to see how Microsoft Copilot is positioning you versus competitors. If you want traffic and conversion attribution, you connect GA4 — that\'s a standard marketing-level integration.'
    },
    {
      id: 'faq-9',
      question: 'Who on my team should own this?',
      answer: 'Most teams loop in three groups: Product marketing: to understand positioning and competitive claims inside Microsoft Copilot. Demand gen / growth: to prove that Microsoft Copilot is (or isn\'t) driving traffic, conversions, and pipeline. Content / SEO: to see which prompts to win next and which pages Microsoft Copilot already trusts. Comms / legal also taps in when inaccurate or risky claims start to show up.'
    },
    {
      id: 'faq-10',
      question: 'Is any of this data shared with other customers or exposed to competitors?',
      answer: 'No. Your tracked prompts, competitor set, traffic data, and insights are private to your workspace. ANALYZE doesn\'t reshare your view of how Microsoft Copilot talks about you.'
    },
    {
      id: 'faq-11',
      question: 'Can I use ANALYZE for more than Microsoft Copilot?',
      answer: 'Yes. You can run this same analysis across multiple AI assistants and AI search engines (for example, Microsoft Copilot, Perplexity, ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, etc.). That lets you see which channel is actually driving demand right now — and where you\'re starting to slip.'
